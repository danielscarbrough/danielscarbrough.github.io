<h1 style="font-family:verdana;text-align: center;">Allen Engineering Internship
</h1>
  
<p class="text">
  
The summer of 2024, I participated in an internship as a manufacturing engineer at the local company Allen Engineering Corporation. I worked alongside four other engineers to assist in quality control and
manufacturing efficiency for the company. I particularly utilized my mechanical CAD skills, using them for 3D design and FEA analysis.

A major portion of my time at Allen Engineering was spent designing and drafting fixtures and jigs for the company using Autodesk Inventor. My largest task was creating a weld fixture to fit the large chassis
of the company's latest riding trowel. This fixture would streamline the welding process for the welders in the production facility. I consistently communicated with the welders who would be using the fixture,
ensuring that the model would fit their specifications and needs, while also being simple to manufacture. The drafts for the two part fixture is pictured below, along with two smaller projects for developing
a painting rack for powder coats and a shelving unit for storing specific assemblies. All shown diagrams have been approved for view by Allen Engineering Corp.

While I was unable to see all projects from design to assembly, I oversaw the manufacturing of multiple designs. I worked with the manufacturing and engineering teams to ensure the designs matched the company's
capabilities and standards. I also followed up with production to ensure the components met the necessary quality for assembly. Pictured below are the assemblies for a component rack and the aforementioned shelving unit.
