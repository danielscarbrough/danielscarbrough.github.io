<h1 style="font-family:verdana;text-align: center;">LUSCE Junior Project
</h1>
  
<p class="text">
  
In my junior year at university, I took the initiative to participate as a junior member in a senior design team. I ended up joining the LUSCE senior design team, which stands for LeTourneau University
Smart Charging Exploration. The team was tasked with developing a charging station for a small 72V electric vehicle, powered by a mobile solar panel station. Junior members are tasked with assisting the team 
for three hours a week, but I ended up working an average of six or seven hours weekly. While I entered the project with an electrical engineering mindset, the team was lacking experience in mechanical engineering. 
I volunteered to assist the sole mechanical engineering senior on the team in developing a chassis for our electronic components, and a stand for our solar panels.

I was able to use my creative interests and talents to further assist the team by designing the team logo, as well as the final poster for display at the university. I enjoyed the opportunity to use the skills developed
outside of university to further support the team.
