My senior year at university, I participated in the On-PAR senior design team with thirteen other members, including a faculty sponsor. Our team was tasked with creating a putting aid device that would track and collect
both errant and accurate putts. We designed a robot that could recognize golf balls using computer vision, estimate their position based on the machine vision bounding box, and collect the golf ball using drive motors
and flywheels.

As the most experienced programmer on the team, I became the team's lead software developer. I used a Raspberry Pi 5 running Ubuntu as the operating system of choice for the project, programming in Python. Early in
the project's lifespan, I discovered the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), and taught myself the basics of ROS 2 to streamline the integration of motors and sensors. I spent the majority of the first semester coding
the basic control system for the device.

The second semester, I shifted my focus to developing computer vision systems for golf ball tracking. I used Ultralytics YOLO algorithm for recognition combined with a BOTSORT algorithm for tracking golf balls across
multiple frames. I used the size of the bounding boxes to approximate the distance the golf ball was from the camera, and plotted the distance onto the system's touchscreen display.

I finished my portion of the project a few weeks before presentations, so I spent the last few weeks of the project assisting the power systems team using my electrical engineering skills. I helped redesign some of
the electrical wiring that was inefficient or failing, creating a tight wiring harness that sufficiently powered the system.
